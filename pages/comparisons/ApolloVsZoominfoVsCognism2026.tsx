      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="mb-4">After 6+ years in sales ops, 100k+ cold calls, and testing dozens of B2B data platforms, I have learned that choosing between Apollo, ZoomInfo, and Cognism is not about features—it is about finding the right fit for your team size, budget, and data quality needs.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Here is my honest breakdown of all three platforms, based on real operational experience across SaaS, Fintech, and traditional sales companies ranging from 5-figure to 7-figure ARR.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Quick Comparison Table</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Apollo: Best for startups and small teams | 0-99 per month | 200M+ contacts | Good for prospecting + email outreach</p>
        <p className="mb-4">ZoomInfo: Best for enterprise sales teams | 995-3000 per month | 100M+ contacts | Superior data quality, expensive</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Cognism: Best for international prospecting | 900-3000 per month | 400M+ contacts | GDPR-compliant, strong in Europe</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Based on 6+ years of sales operations experience across dozens of companies, I have seen teams succeed with all three. The key is honest assessment of your budget, team size, and data quality requirements before making a decision.</p>
